# Greetings
First smart contract

- String message stored in contract
- Two functions
	- Change the message
	- Retrieve the message
- npm project
- Install dependencies
	- npm install web3@0.20.0 solc
	- solc is the solidity compiler, which turns solidity code into EVM (Ethereum virtual machine) bytecode
	- web3 is used to interact with the Smart Contracts after the bytecode is deployed (remember the architecture, frontend+web3js <=> backend of Eth nodes))
